https://github.com/rumpkernel/wiki/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Building-Rumprun-Unikernels

"The first thing to note is that Rumprun unikernels are always cross-compiled. In practical terms, that statement means that the compiler will never run on a Rumprun unikernel. Instead, the compiler always runs on a build host (e.g. a regular Linux/BSD system). In case a software package supports cross-compiling, odds are that you can just compile it as a Rumprun unikernel. If the software package uses a custom build system which does not support cross-compilation, you will first have to add cross-compile support to the build system in question. Since we are optimistic, and since modifying an arbitrary build system to support cross-compilation is beyond the scope of this tutorial, we assume cross-compilable software."

first, compile using the cross-compiler wrapper provided by rumprun:
> x86_64-rumprun-netbsd-gcc main.c -o testrump

now, the binary needs to be "baked", i.e. the kernel components added:
> rumprun-bake hw_generic testrump.bin testrump

now, the binary can be run with e.g. kvm or qemu:
> rumprun kvm -i testrump.bin

----------------------

0x0000000000001000 - 0x0000000100000000: user space, identity mapping (first 4 GB)
0x0000000100000000 - 0x00007f8000000000: user space, unmapped

the entire virtual memory seems to be mapped by rumprubb/platform/hw/arch/amd64/pagetable.S

---------------------

interesting file: ./buildrump.sh/dest.stage/usr/include/rump/rumpkern_if_pub.h
maybe we could write a kernel module?

rumprun/tests is very interesting, especially ./nolibc
rumprun/src-netbsd/sys/rump/librump/rumpkern - seems to be the rumpkernel itself

rumprun/obj-amd64-hw/dest.stage/rumprun-x86_64/lib/rumprun-hw/rumprun.o:
  000000000000ce60 T bmk_pgalloc
  000000000000cc70 T bmk_pgalloc_align
  000000000000cac0 T bmk_pgalloc_dumpstats
  000000000000cb80 T bmk_pgalloc_loadmem

scanning memory we find bmk_pgalloc() at 0x10ee60, so we know that the kernel .text is at 0x102000

----------------

there's 64 MB physical memory available in total, and yet 4 GB address space is identity-mapped in????

----------------- benchmarking --------------------

Set up iptap:
> sudo ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap
> sudo ip addr add 10.0.120.100/24 dev tap0
> sudo ip link set dev tap0 up

Build rumprun redis:
> source rumprun/obj-amd64-hw/config-PATH.sh
> cd rumprun-packages/redis
> make
> rumprun-bake hw_generic bin/redis-server.bin bin/redis-server

Run it:
> rumprun qemu -i -M 256 \
    -I if,vioif,'-net tap,script=no,ifname=tap0' \
    -W if,inet,static,10.0.120.100/24 \
    -b images/data.iso,/data \
    -b images/datapers.img,/backup \
    -- bin/redis-server.bin /data/conf/redisaof.conf
