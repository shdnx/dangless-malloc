will need to re-compile the application anyway:
 - link to libdune
 - enter dune mode at some point before main()

Koen has stuff for this: can write a static library that's linked to the application itself
in the static library, you write a .preinit function that enters Dune

to support fork(), exec() and pthread_create(), need to modify Dune so that the new application enters Dune again
look at what the sandbox example application of dune did (trap.c @ pthread_entry)
