1) performance and memory overhead measurements of SPEC
2) multi-threading support
3) test multi-threaded applications
  web servers: nginx, lighttp, Apache, ...
  for performance testing for them:
   - A/B benchmark
   - Apache benchmark
   - httperf
  check: previous vusec papers to see which ones they traditionally use
  don't just measure pure throughput: measure at least 2: latency, throughput, CPU utilization, memory utilization (physical and virtual)

  Redis, memcached

4) use huge-pages when possible for the virtual remapped thing; could have a huge impact on performance
