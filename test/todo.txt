General:
 - implement dangless_realloc()
 - __attribute__((malloc)) on dangless_malloc() and dangless_calloc()?
 - span merging in the virtual page allocator

Rumprun:
 - fix the problem that rumprun also strong_alias-es malloc et al
 - refactor/unite the platform-specific virtual_remap.c files, or at least inherit the enchancements from the Dune version
 - make the physical page allocator thread-safe
 - span merging in the physical page allocator

Low-priority general:
 - for huge allocations (that are >= 2 MB), we could use hugepages
 - create regression test framework
 - design the garbage collector
 - aligned_alloc()? rumprun doesn't implement it

Low-priority Rumprun:
 - mirror output to disk; look into how the rumprun tests do this
 - look into Cristiano's suggestion with the pre-linking to get rid of the rumprun offsets; or, if that's not an option, automate getting the offsets from the rumprun binaries
