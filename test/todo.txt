General:
 - implement realloc()
 - make the virtual page allocator thread-safe
 - make the physical page allocator thread-safe
 - Automatically call dangless_dedicate_vmem() as soon as it's safe. I guess just take all available PML4 entries?
 - __attribute__((malloc))?
 - span merging in the physical/virtual page allocator
 - design the garbage collector
 - create regression test framework
 - aligned_alloc()? rumprun doesn't implement it

Rumprun:
 - mirror output to disk; look into how the rumprun tests do this

 - look into Cristiano's suggestion with the pre-linking to get rid of the rumprun offsets; or, if that's not an option, automate getting the offsets from the rumprun binaries

Low-priority:
 - for huge allocations (that are >= 2 MB), we could use hugepages
