 - mirror output to disk; look into how the rumprun tests do this
 - make the virtual and physical page allocator thread-safe
 - overwrite the malloc/free/etc. symbols
 - implement calloc, realloc, memalign, etc.

 - look into Cristiano's suggestion with the pre-linking to get rid of the rumprun offsets; or, if that's not an option, automate getting the offsets from the rumprun binaries
 - span merging in the physical/virtual page allocator
 - design the garbage collector
 - create regression test framework
