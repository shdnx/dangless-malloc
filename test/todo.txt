General:
 - dangless_realloc() should take into account the size of the malloc header, otherwise it cannot well calculate the number of pages needed
 - each unit test case should start with a clean slate: vp_reset() and the dangless_dedicate_vmem() to always the same location (probably also unmap the pages)
    this will need a TEST_SETUP() and TEST_CLEANUP() or something similar
 - garbage collector
 - memalign(), valloc()

Test framework:
 - strong override fprintf() and printf(): only print test output if verbose mode is on
 - auto-indentation of output?

Optimisations:
 - virtual page allocator: have thread-local regions, e.g. split them up per PML4 entry or so
    is it worth optimising for using as little virtual memory as possible, so that we don't need that many page tables, and maybe it's better for the TLB as well?
 - pt_map_page(): similarly to the virtual page allocator, have a separate mutex for each e.g. PML4 entry, to let unrelated (re)mappings proceed in parallel
 - for big enough remappings, we could use hugepages
 - replace mutexes with spinlocks at most places

------------------------------------------------

Rumprun:
 - fix the problem that rumprun also strong_alias-es malloc et al
 - refactor/unite the platform-specific virtual_remap.c files, or at least inherit the enchancements from the Dune version
 - make the physical page allocator thread-safe
 - span merging in the physical page allocator

Low-priority general:
 - for huge allocations (that are >= 2 MB), we could use hugepages
 - design the garbage collector
 - aligned_alloc()? rumprun doesn't implement it

Low-priority Rumprun:
 - mirror output to disk; look into how the rumprun tests do this
 - look into Cristiano's suggestion with the pre-linking to get rid of the rumprun offsets; or, if that's not an option, automate getting the offsets from the rumprun binaries
